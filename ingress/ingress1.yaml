With Ingress, users do not connect directly to a Service. Users reach the Ingress endpoint, and, from there, the request is forwarded to the desired Service. You can see an example of a Name-Based Virtual Hosting Ingress definition below:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream: "true"
  name: virtual-host-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: blue.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-blue-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  - host: green.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: webserver-green-svc
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific

In the example above, user requests to both blue.example.com and green.example.com would go to the same Ingress endpoint, and, from there, they would be forwarded to webserver-blue-svc, and webserver-green-svc, respectively.
