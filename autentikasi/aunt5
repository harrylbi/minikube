Authentication and Authorization Demo Guide (5)

While in the default minikube context, create a new deployment in the lfs158 namespace:

~/rbac$ kubectl -n lfs158 create deployment nginx --image=nginx:alpine

deployment.apps/nginx created

From the new context bob-context try to list pods. The attempt fails because user bob has no permissions configured for the bob-context:

~/rbac$ kubectl --context=bob-context get pods

Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "bob" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "lfs158"

The following steps will assign a limited set of permissions to user bob in the bob-context. 

Create a YAML configuration manifest for a pod-reader Role object, which allows only get, watch, list actions/verbs in the lfs158 namespace against pod resources. Then create the role object and list it from the default minikube context, but from the lfs158 namespace:

~/rbac$ vim role.yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: lfs158
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

~/rbac$ kubectl create -f role.yaml

role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-reader created

~/rbac$ kubectl -n lfs158 get roles
